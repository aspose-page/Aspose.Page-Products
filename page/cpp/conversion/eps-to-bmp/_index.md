 In order to convert EPS to BMP, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Page for C++](https://products.aspose.com/page/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.page) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.Page.Cpp** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.Page is an XPS and PostScript formats manipulation and parsing API. One can easily create, modify and convert XPS, EPS And PS formats to PDF and images. Furthermore, one can also manipulate document pages as well as elements, create vector graphics, group shapes and more. Its a standalone API and does not require any other software installation.

FIles with EPS extension essentially describe an Encapsulated PostScript language program that describes the appearance of a single page. The name "Encapsulated" because it can be included or encapsulated in another PostScript language page description. This script based file format may contain any combination of text, graphics and images. EPS files may include a bitmap preview image encapsulated inside for display by applications that can open such files. EPS files can be converted to standard image formats such as JPG, PNG, TIFF and PDF using different applications e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and PaintShop Pro. Because of a security vulnerability in EPS files, Office 2016, Office 2013, Office 2010, and Office 365 have turned off the ability to insert EPS files into Office documents.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="BMP" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/" >}}

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
