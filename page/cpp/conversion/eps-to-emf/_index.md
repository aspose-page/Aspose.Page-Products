 In order to convert EPS to EMF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Page for C++](https://products.aspose.com/page/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.page) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.Page.Cpp** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.Page API makes it easy for the developers to convert EPS file to EMF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load EPS file with Aspose.Page for C++.
1.  Call the Save() method.
1.  Pass the output file path with (EMF) file extension.
1.  EMF file will be saved at the specified path.
1.  Open EMF file in compatible program.

 Aspose.Page is an XPS and PostScript formats manipulation and parsing API. One can easily create, modify and convert XPS, EPS And PS formats to PDF and images. Furthermore, one can also manipulate document pages as well as elements, create vector graphics, group shapes and more. Its a standalone API and does not require any other software installation. ‎

FIles with EPS extension essentially describe an Encapsulated PostScript language program that describes the appearance of a single page. The name "Encapsulated" because it can be included or encapsulated in another PostScript language page description. This script based file format may contain any combination of text, graphics and images. EPS files may include a bitmap preview image encapsulated inside for display by applications that can open such files. EPS files can be converted to standard image formats such as JPG, PNG, TIFF and PDF using different applications e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and PaintShop Pro. Because of a security vulnerability in EPS files, Office 2016, Office 2013, Office 2010, and Office 365 have turned off the ability to insert EPS files into Office documents.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="EMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/emf/" >}}

Enhanced metafile format (EMF) stores graphical images device-independently. Metafiles of EMF comprises of variable-length records in chronological order that can render the stored image after parsing on any output device. These variable-length records can be definitions of enclosed objects, commands for drawing, and graphics properties critical to render the image accurately. When a device opens an EMF metafile using its own graphics environment, the proportions, dimensions, colors and other graphic properties of original image remains same regardless of the opening device platform.
