        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XPS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/xps/" >}}
An XPS file represents page layout files that are based on XML Paper Specifications created by Microsoft. This format was developed by Microsoft as a replacement of EMF file format and is similar to PDF file format, but uses XML in layout, appearance, and printing information of a document. It is, in fact, more justified to say that XPS is an attempt on PDF, but couldn't get enough popularity as owned by PDF for a number of reasons. Microsoft provides XPS Document Writer by default from Windows 7 onwards for the creation of XPS files. XPS files can be generated by selecting the "Microsoft XPS Document Writer" as printer while printing the document.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="bmp" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/" >}}
Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
