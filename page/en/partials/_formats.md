{{<section EPS>}}

EPS (ERSF) or Encapsulated PostScript File Format is the format that is actually a PS program that describes what would a single page look like. It is actually limited PS plus particular notes that help encapsulate PostScript graphics to another document. EPS perfectly supports vector graphics or combined vector-raster graphics. The peculiarity of the format is that as soon as it is imported into a document, it cannot be edited anymore. That is one of the reasons to convert this format to the one you are able to work with.

{{<section PS>}}

PS format is one of the page description language (PDL) formats. It is capable to contain graphic as well as text information on the page. That is why the format was supported by most of the programs for image editing. The postscript file itself is a kind of instruction for printers. It contains information on what and how to print from its page.

{{<section XPS>}}

XPS format is similar to PDF format. Both are page description language (PDL) formats. EPS is based on HTML and not on PostScript language. The .eps file is capable to contain a markup of the document's structure along with the information on how the document would look like. There are also added instructions on how to print and render the document. The feature of the format is that it fixes the document's description which means that it will look the same no matter who and from what operational system opens it.

{{<section BMP>}}

Bitmap Image File or BMP is a raster-saving image format. It is used to save bitmap digital images and is capable to store 2d graphics in color or monochrome in the high quality as the TIFF format does. It also can contain image information like data compression, color profiles, alpha channels, etc. BMP images are independent of the graphics adapter so the files can be opened on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac.

{{<section EMF>}}

Enhanced metafile format or EMF is an image format created by MS for Windows. The format is capable to store graphical images device-independently. The format creates variable-length records so that when a device opens an EMF metafile by means of its own graphics environment, all the proportions and properties of the image remain no matter what platform or environment you use.

{{<section GIF>}}

Graphics Interchange Format as it is known worldwide as GIF is a graphic format for light-weighted animation. It is a bitmap image format with lossless compression. It is perfect for creating content with a limited number of colors, for low-quality videos. You may find GIFs on any social network, messenger, or other communication solution.

Because of this JPEG format is well spread on e-commerce platforms in listings.

{{<section PNG>}}

Portable Network Graphics or PNG is one of the most popular image formats. It gives you really good compression maintaining the high level of quality of the picture. PNG is also one of the best formats for web projects, as the files are lighter and images are easy to scale.

{{<section TIFF>}}

The Tag Image File Format format is a format spread among photographers. It lets keep really high-quality images, like fabulous macro photos of flowers, insects, or dew drops you may have seen. TIFF stores image information and raster graphics. Storing that much information makes the images of this format pretty heavy, so TIFF is not good in cases when you need to save space.

{{<section WMF>}}

Windows Metafile or WMF is an image file created to save vector graphics. To be more accurate, WMF belongs to the vector file format category of Graphics file formats that is device independent. As EMF this format also contains metafile records that store drawing operations and commands to save the proportions and properties of the image no matter what platform or environment you use.
